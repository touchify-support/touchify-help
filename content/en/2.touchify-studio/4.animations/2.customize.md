::note
**Prerequisites:** apply an animation to your element or page. To learn more, see [introduction to animations](introduction)
::

## Timing

Define the **appearance time** *(clock icon)* and the **duration of your animation** *(stopwatch icon)*. Modify the **speed curve** to adjust your element's movement.

<div class="my-4 grid sm:grid-cols-3 gap-4 max-w-full">
  <img src="/2-touchify-studio/4-animations/2-customize/fr-studio-anim-temps.webp" alt="Setting animation timing" />
  <img src="/2-touchify-studio/4-animations/2-customize/fr-studio-anim-courbe.webp" alt="Setting animation speed curve" class="sm:col-span-2" />
</div>

:nuxt-img{src="/2-touchify-studio/4-animations/2-customize/fr-studio-anim-courbe-demo.webp" alt="Animation speed curve demonstration" provider="none" class="w-full"}

::caution
**Warning:** you can apply multiple animations to the same element, but conflicts may appear if animations trigger at the same time.
**Offset their timer** *(clock icon)* to avoid display bugs.

## Effects

### Zoom and fade

Refine your animation appearance by activating zoom and/or fade effects: they will complement the animation style without modifying other parameters.

### Repeat animation

Apply a repetition effect: control the number of repeats and the duration between each repetition.

### Special options

Some options are specific to an animation. The parameters are then specified in the window. Modify them according to your needs.

### Initialization

By default, an element is invisible before its appearance animation is triggered.

To cancel this behavior, click the **"Do not hide on initialization"** option switch.
