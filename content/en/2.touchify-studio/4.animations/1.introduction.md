## Element Animation

To animate an element, select it then click the **"Animation"** button *(bounce icon)* in the right sidebar.
The panel will open on the **animations list**: select the one you want to apply to the element then modify its settings (duration, speed curve...) in the new **Element animations** panel.

<div class="mt-4 grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 max-w-full">

</div>

::caution
**Caution:** you can apply multiple animations to the same element, but some conflicts may appear if the animations trigger at the same time.
**Offset their timer** *(clock icon)* to avoid display bugs.

## Animation Type

Animations are separated into four families. Each corresponds to a type of use described below.

::note
The Opacity animation has been chosen to illustrate this article; you can choose other animations in your project.

### Entrance

These animations are designed for the appearance of elements, when the page opens.

### Exit

In parallel with the "Entrance" section, this list concerns exit animations.

### Transform

These animations modify the position, size or transparency of the element over the long term.

### Call to Action

These animations are designed as loops, so they can be repeated to attract the user's attention.

## Page Transitions

Apply page animations to smooth navigation.

Click the **"Page transitions"** button *(page/bounce icon)* in the right sidebar.
Choose the animations of your choice: page entrance and exit are independent.

*Since the panels are already classified by animation type, you will not find the four families offered for element animations.*
