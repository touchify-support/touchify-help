## Apply an Interaction

Select your element then click the **"Element interactions"** button *(touch icon)* in the right sidebar. Click the **"Add an interaction"** button.

In the proposed list, choose the action that this element will trigger when the user interacts with it.

A settings tab will be created for each added interaction.

Indeed, it is possible to apply multiple interactions to the same element: to avoid conflicts, make sure to choose a different **trigger** for each of them.

<div class="mt-4 grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 max-w-full">
  <img src="/2-touchify-studio/3-interactions/1-introduction/fr-studio-interactions-panneau-unique.webp" alt="Interactions panel with a single interaction" />
  <img src="/2-touchify-studio/3-interactions/1-introduction/fr-studio-interactions-panneau-multiple.webp" alt="Interactions panel with multiple interactions" />
</div>

## Triggers

The trigger determines how the user can interact with the object.

Select the interaction then click on the **"Trigger"** panel: unfold the button and choose from the proposed options.

- **Touch:** touch (or click) to activate
- **Double touch:** touch twice (or double-click) to activate
- **Multiple touch:** choose the number of touches (or clicks) needed to activate the action
- **Long press:** hold a touch (or click) to activate
- **Swipe (touch screens only):** swipe the screen in the direction of your choice to trigger the action
- **Keyboard or remote:** connect the buttons of a peripheral (keyboard, remote...) to the trigger

::note
Although this article takes element interactions as an example, it is possible to make the entire page interactive.
<br><br>
Click the **"Page interactions"** button *(touch/page icon)* in the right sidebar.
The same functionalities will be offered to you, with the difference that the **triggers will be applied to the entire page and not to a targeted element**.
