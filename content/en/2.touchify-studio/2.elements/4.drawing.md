## Customize

### Color and Outline

Click on your element then on the **"Element customization"** button in the menu on the right of the interface. Customize the background and border color in the **"Color and outline"** panel.

Click on the color dots to modify the hue; drag the slider to **adjust opacity**.

Modify the outline size and corner rounding according to your needs.

::caution
Customization of imported elements (text, image...) allows you to modify different outlines and angles independently.
Shapes do not have this functionality: **outlines and angles cannot be separated**.
::

### Angle and Orientation (optional)

Some shapes can be customized in detail: number of branches for a star, degree of inclination for a trapezoid...
These parameters can be modified in the **"Customize"** panel, just above **"Color and outline"**.
