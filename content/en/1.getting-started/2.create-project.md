### Project Type

Several parameters need to be defined when you create a new project.

Three project types are suggested to you: each of them allows you to optimize the features you will use in the Studio.

- **Interactive Display:** offers a wide choice of different interactions and allows you to customize the project features in depth
- **Dynamic Display:** deepens automatic sequencing, conditions and page transitions functionalities
- **Dynamic Presentation:** adapted for presentation-type projects, possibility to export in PDF format

### Resolution

The format of your project is fully customizable.

A wide list of dimensions is offered to you, classified by resolution or by device type; if needed, enter the desired dimensions by clicking on the right button **"Customize"**.

### Classification Options

You can classify your project in a team or in a folder from its creation.

The **"Team"** function manages accessibility to the project: it can only be seen or modified by members of the selected team.

The **"Folder"** function simply allows you to classify your projects in different categories.
