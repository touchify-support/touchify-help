Still in the panel, rename this page by double-clicking on it or by performing **right click** > **"Rename"**.

<div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 max-w-full">

  <img src="/1-getting-started/4-create-interactive-content/fr-interactif-renommer.webp" alt="Rename a page" />
</div>

To modify the position of a page in the tree structure, **hold down a left click and drag the page** to the desired location. A blue highlight will indicate where your page will be dropped.
