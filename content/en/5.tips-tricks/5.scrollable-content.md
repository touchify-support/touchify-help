## Elements compatible with scrolling

This functionality can be applied to several types of elements. It is activated in the **Element Customization** tab *(target icon)* to the right of the workspace:

- **Text**: check the *Allow scrolling* option in the *Scrolling Options* window
- **Menu**: check the *Allow scrolling* option in the *Display Options* window
- **Custom component**: choose the *Scrolling* option in the *Display mode* menu of the *Component* window
- **Text & custom windows**: check the *Allow scrolling* option in the *Scrolling Options* window
 

## Creating a scrolling custom component

### Step 1: Create the content

Add to your page the elements that will appear in the area.

To choose an image, expand the **"Gallery"** tab *(image icon)* in the left sidebar then select your desired image.
To insert it, click the **"+"** button or drag it directly into the page.

To add other types of media (videos, pdfs...) expand **the corresponding tab** in the left sidebar. Insert your media the same way as an image.
Don't forget to [import your media into the gallery](../touchify-studio/elements/media) beforehand.

Customize the size and position of your image in the **"Options"** window *(crosshair icon)*, to the right of the workspace.

To add text, click the **"Text"** button in the insertion menu.
Choose the style you want to apply or draw the block directly on the page.

Customize the element in the **"Element Customization"** tabs *(crosshair icon)* to the right of the workspace.
Modify the text and block style as you wish: change typography, size, text color, add a colored background to the block...

### Step 2: Transform into component

First, make sure that **all elements of your future area** are gathered on your page, arranged in the desired location.
**Some elements must overflow**, so that the scrolling area is visible in its entirety; leave in the page the elements that will appear as priority.

Select all your elements then right-click: choose the **"Transform into component"** option in the window.

Name your component and modify its parameters in the **configuration window**. Dimensions and position are entered automatically, you don't need to modify them.
Once configuration is complete, click the **"Validate"** button.

<div class="mt-4 grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 max-w-full">

  <img src="/5-tips-tricks/5-scrollable-content/fr-tips-scroll-composant-formulaire.webp" alt="Component creation form" />
</div>

### Step 3: Configure the component

The component is automatically **inserted in the page, at the location where it was created**.
Adjust its size to fit the page dimensions: surplus elements must now be invisible, **hidden in the component block**.

To allow scrolling, select the component then access the windows in the **"Element Customization"** tab *(crosshair icon)* in the right sidebar:
in the **"Component"** window, select the *Scrolling* display mode.

::note
You can modify your component at any time: select it then click the **"Edit"** button *(pencil icon)* in the customization window, to the right of the workspace.
<br><br>
You can also access the component management space: in the bottom menu of the **"Pages"** window, to the left of the workspace, click the **"Component"** button *(C icon)*.
Select your component to modify it.
<br><br>
To return to the project pages, click the **"Project pages"** button *(page icon)* in the same menu.

### Step 4: Preview

To preview the project, click the **"Preview"** button at the top left of the workspace. This mode will allow you to visualize and test the scrolling area you just created.

## Automatic scrolling options

While classic scrolling is triggered by interaction, automatic scrolling plays independently.
To activate this option, click the **"Element Customization"** tab *(target icon)* in the right menu then expand the **"Scrolling Options"** window.

3. Modify the scrolling type: return to beginning, reverse scrolling, continuous scrolling, entrance and exit
