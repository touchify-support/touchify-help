## Introduction

Touchify supports many video formats. However, for better compatibility we recommend **MP4** and **WebM** formats.

We offer you in this article a solution to optimize videos imported into Touchify.
Obviously this solution is not unique and many tools are available.
We will use here two free tools without constraining limitations:

- Any Video Converter (PC, Mac)
- Video Smaller (online)

## First Step: Any Video Converter

Any Video Converter (AVC) is free software, available on PC and Mac, offering a large number of video processing features and very good performance in managing MP4 files.

Let's start with a first optimization phase with the following options:

- MP4 format (HTML5 category)
- Keep original size
- High quality

Depending on the characteristics of the original file, the weight can be divided by 5 on average.
For example, 200 MB for an original file of 1 GB, without quality loss.

::note
It is also possible to reduce the dimensions of the video. However, we recommend performing this operation in the next step.

## Second Step: Video Smaller

Video Smaller (VS) is an online solution for compressing and resizing videos with or without quality loss.
The main limitation concerns file size, limited to 500 MB.

### Compression

The maximum compression option is very effective and allows significant weight reduction while maintaining satisfactory quality.
For optimal quality, select the **Use low compression level** option.

### Resizing

Depending on the targeted devices or the display size of the video in your project, it is advisable to reduce the video dimensions and thus further reduce the weight of the final file.

## Results Obtained

Here is an example of results obtained from an MP4 video file of **1.1 GB** without resizing, without quality loss or moderate loss:

### First compression with AVC in high quality
Final weight: **196 MB**, **divided by 5**.

### Second compression with VS in high quality
Final weight: **118 MB**, **divided by 10**.

### Second compression with VS in maximum compression
Final weight: **72 MB**, **divided by 15**.

## Conclusion

If only one solution had to be kept, Video Smaller is the one that offers the best results while remaining very simple to use. The main disadvantage is the duration of the operation due to loading times to send then download the file.

On the contrary, Any Video Converter allows you to obtain a first compression very quickly. The combination of the 2 tools seems to us to be an optimal solution.
