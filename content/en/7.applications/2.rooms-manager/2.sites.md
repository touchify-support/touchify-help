**What is a Site?**
<br><br>
In Rooms Manager, sites allow you to organize your meeting rooms and users. Each site contains meeting rooms that inherit its configuration. Additionally, when you add users, you can define which sites they have the right to reserve rooms in.
<br><br>
A site can correspond to a floor, geographical area, city (as in the example), building...

## Manage sites

To access your site list, click on the **Sites** section in the menu on the left of the screen.

You can then click on one of the tiles to configure your site.
