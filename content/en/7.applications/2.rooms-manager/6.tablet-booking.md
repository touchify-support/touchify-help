## Accessing the Tablet

When you access the room booking tablet, you choose the room you want to book and then select the time slot that suits you (in our example, it will be the Touch room).

## Choosing a Time Slot

You can either tap the purple "Book a slot" button or select the date and slot directly at the bottom of the screen. The orange color indicates the start time of the meeting you are about to schedule.

To complete your booking, you must enter your user code. This code consists of six digits.

## Booking Confirmation

Your booking is immediately taken into account and communicated to all connected tablets.

When you check the booking schedule for your room, your booking appears in "red," indicating that this slot is now assigned. The meeting room will no longer be available at this time.
