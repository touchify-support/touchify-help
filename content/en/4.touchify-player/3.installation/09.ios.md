## Configure kiosk mode

Here are two options to configure an iPad in kiosk mode.

### Option 1: Single App Mode

As the name suggests, this mode allows you to lock the device to a single application.
While effective, this method can be restrictive: it requires using the Apple Configurator app from a Mac or using an MDM solution.

For **Apple Configurator**, simply connect the iPad with a USB cable. Once the device is recognized, enable **Supervised Mode**, then in the **Actions / Advanced** menu, select **Start Single App Mode** and select the **Touchify Player** app.

### Option 2: Guided Access Mode

The advantage of this method is that it does not require any tools and can be done directly on the device.
Start by enabling the **Guided Access** feature from the iPad's general settings and configure the **Passcode Settings**.

Once the feature is enabled, launch the Touchify Player app and then triple-click the iPad's Home button to start Guided Access. Configure according to your needs and then click Start.
