## Install the application

Open the **URL Launcher** tool on Tizen

![Tizen home screen](/4-touchify-player/3-installation/5-tizen/fr-player-tizen-accueil.webp)

In the settings, enter the following URL:<br>
**https://get.touchify.io/tizen**

![Launching URL on Tizen](/4-touchify-player/3-installation/5-tizen/fr-player-tizen-lanceur.webp)

::caution
On some older versions of Tizen, the above URL may not work due to a certificate issue.
This is a security vulnerability on these Tizen versions, so we recommend updating the screen's firmware. The URL will then work and the vulnerability will be fixed.
<br><br>
If updating the firmware is not possible, you can install the application using the following URL:
<br>
**https://touchifyapplications.blob.core.windows.net/tizen**

## Associate the screen with a broadcast group

Use your deployment key to associate the device with one or more broadcast groups and control it from Touchify Publisher.
