## Initial setup

### Google account

Generally, Android TV requires connecting the device with a Google account. You can create a specific account for your project, for example *mycustomer.mycompany.signage@gmail.com*.

On some devices, it is possible to skip this step. In that case, Google Play will not be available and installing applications will require connecting the device to a computer. More information in the section [Install an application with ADB](#use-adb-to-install-an-application-optional).

## Use ADB to install an application (optional)

### Where to find ADB?

If you have installed the Android development tools on your computer, ADB is located in the *platform-tools* folder of the SDK, for example *AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools*.

You can also download ADB from [Google Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).

### Where to find applications?

Several websites list Android applications, for example [APK Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/).

Search for an application and select the latest version that matches your Android version.

The Touchify Player application is available on our website:

::u-button{variant="primary" to="https://get.touchify.io" target="_blank" icon="i-lucide-download"}

```bash
adb install -r "PATH\TO\FILE\package.apk"
