---

## Install the application

Two installation options are available for Android:

- **Web application:** simple, no permissions required, no system features
- **Native application:** installation from the application package

::caution
Only the native application allows configuring a secure kiosk mode.
We recommend using the web application only if it's impossible to install the native application or in user login scenarios.
::

### Option 1: web application

Use Google Chrome on your Android device to access the URL: [https://player.touchify.io](https://player.touchify.io).

Open the browser settings and select Add to home screen.

</div>

Installation complete, the Touchify Player application is installed on your device and accessible from the home screen.

### Option 2: native application

Download the Touchify Player application for Android on your device: [Touchify APK](https://get.touchify.io/android).

Open the `touchify.apk` file to install the application.

::caution
**Specific permission**
<br>
In some cases, the system will ask to authorize the installation of unknown applications to install the package.
::

::note
**Additional features**
<br>
The native application includes an automatic update mechanism. It also offers specific features: configure a secure kiosk mode, set a project as a custom application launcher, use Touchify as a screensaver...
::

## Connect

The Touchify Player application offers 2 authentication modes.

### Connect with a user account

Use your credentials to connect to your user account and access your published projects.

For more information, see the [Introduction to Touchify Publisher](../../touchify-publisher/introduction) article.

## Configure kiosk mode

### Prerequisites

The native application is installed and the device is connected to a broadcast group.

::note
**Recommendation**
<br>
It is recommended to enable kiosk mode in the broadcast group configuration and set a password to restrict access to the application settings.
::

::tip
**Good to know**
<br>
To access settings or close the application in secure kiosk mode, touch the 4 corners of the screen successively starting from the top left corner, clockwise.
<br>
*Special case: this feature is disabled if the password is not set and the "Hide all buttons" option is enabled.*
::

### Option 1: simple kiosk

This method allows you to secure an Android device simply but with certain limitations. In particular, system elements may appear by swiping from the top or bottom of the screen although they are inactive. This does not impact the security of the device.

::caution
New limitations make this method non-optimal on Android 12+.
::

To enable kiosk mode, access the application's system settings.

Confirm kiosk mode activation, then set Touchify Player as the home application or Home App. This screen may change depending on Android versions.

The Touchify Player application then restarts in kiosk mode. You can disable or temporarily suspend kiosk mode from the application's system settings.

### Option 2: advanced kiosk

This method allows you to set up a fully secure kiosk mode by configuring the Touchify Player application as Device Owner using Android Device Bridge (ADB).

1. Connect the device to a computer using a USB cable;
2. Enable USB debugging;
3. Run the following commands with ADB:

```bash
## check if your device is available and authorized
adb devices

## install the touchify package
adb install -r "PATH\TO\touchify.apk"

## set device owner
adb shell dpm set-device-owner co.touchify.player/co.touchify.cordova.plugin.kiosk.KioskDeviceAdminReceiver 
```

That's it, the application will automatically start in secure mode. You can temporarily suspend kiosk mode from the application's system settings.

::tip
**Where to find ADB?**
<br><br>
If Android development tools are installed on your computer, ADB is located in the *SDK platform-tools* folder, for example *AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools*.
<br><br>
You can also download ADB from [Google Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).
